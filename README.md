## Description
Search multiple sites with a single click.
Make searching faster with One Click Search. Simply highlight any text on any webpage and a pop-up will appear, allowing you to search for that term via a range of search engines and websites.

Highly customisable with an intuitive interface - allowing you to show as many or as few search icons as you like, in whatever order you like. 

'Hidden Icons' appear when hovering over the pop-up - allowing more options while keeping a discrete interface.

You can even add your own search engines.
