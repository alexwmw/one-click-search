## Description
**Time Out : Page Blocker** is a Chrome extension and productivity tool, designed to help you stay focussed.

The extension blocks websites of your choosing, enabling you to use your internet browswer productively without getting distracted by troublesome websites. 

However, unlike other website blockers that make it impossible for you to reach the blocked website, **Time Out** will prompt you to hold down a button for a set time if you decide you really did want to visit the page.

This has the advantage of giving you the user the choice of whether you want to complete a visit to the site in any given moment, while also giving you time to pause and think. This 'optional' method is an dvantage over other website blocker that blanket-ban web pages, which can get frustrating and result in the user disabling the extension altogether.
